            <h3>ℹ️ How this works:</h3>
            <p>
                When you scanned the QR code, it brought you to this page. Clicking the confirmation button will automatically send an email to the letter sender letting them know you've received their message. This is a simple and effective way to get delivery confirmation for physical mail.
